# Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition

Smart Attendance System is developed to collect attendance through face recognition functionality. All the back-end services provided in app are connected with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. In this app, user send his/her captured photo to the cloud and attendances are recorded automatically by recognizing face. In addition, by using this app, students can see their attendance by date. To add to it, professors are also able to check the student attendance records by just putting student ID number.
